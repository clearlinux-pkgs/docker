Starting with the Docker 20.10 release, packages for the Docker Engine and
Docker CLI are built directly from their respective source repositories
instead of from the single repository.

Practically this means:
This repository is no longer the “source of truth” for Docker CE builds.
The commit SHA and tag for the Docker Engine will come from the moby/moby
repository.

This package MUST be upgraded in sync with 'docker-cli'

Updating docker:
- Find commit ID for docker release
- Get commit ID for libnetwork (see the vendor.conf file)
- Update Makefile + spec file with new versions and commit IDs
- make generateupstream && make build
